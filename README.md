# Surf and Paddle Website

## Description

As a developer on the web, you will sometimes be tasked with creating an html
page simply from an image file.  In this assignment, I took an
image and turned it into a functioning website.

## Details

### Deliverables

* A repo containing at least:
  * `index.html`
  * 'styles.css'
  * 'images/'

### Requirements

* Using the image located in `assets/surf-and-paddle.png`, create a html
  document using html and css to be a pixel perfect match with the image, but be
  a functioning website.
* The menu items, images, and buttons need to also have differing states based
  on a hover, and although not articulated in the provided image, they need to
  be styled.
* Use [these fonts from Google Web
  Fonts](http://www.google.com/fonts#UsePlace:use/Collection:Oswald%7COpen+Sans)
  in your implementation -- "Open Sans" for most copy, "Oswald" for headings
* Use [the FontAwesome
  icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/cheatsheet/) for the
  "Comments", "Read Later", and "Share This" elements
* [placeholder text of your choice](http://meettheipsums.com) for all copy (not headings)
* [placeholder images of your choosing](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/TheInternetsBestPlaceholderImageSitesForWebDevelopment.aspx)
